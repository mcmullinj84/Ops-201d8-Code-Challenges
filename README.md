# Ops-201d8-Code-Challenges

Welcome! 

This repo is a collection of coding assignments centered around learning the fundamentals of bash and PowerShell.

I am learning these skills to increase my efficiency when completing cybersecurity tasks in the terminal. Through these exercises I learned how to use functions, variables, loops, arguments, and conditionals. Ultimately, I was able to automate some security related processes and have the output be sent to text files.

My favorite Ops Challenge was from class 13 https://github.com/mcmullinj84/Ops-201d8-Code-Challenges/blob/main/ops201d8-day13.sh. It is a simple script but it
was the first bash script I wrote that came 'naturally' without having to work out multiple errors or reference a syntax guide every line. 

Shell scripting can help immensely to automate routine cybersecurity functions and search large datasets. 

Now that I have a better grasp on the concepts I would be nice to return to the Challenge from class 05 and incorporate some <grep> commands to tailor the information provided.

I seek to explore more tasks that I can automate using uncomplicated shell scripts so that I am efficient as possible.
